# Close a Stream


## <a href="" id="ddk-closing-a-stream-ksg"></a>


After a stream operation is completed, the data stream must be closed to free the resources that were allocated by the open stream request.

If the stream *State* is not stopped or there is pending I/O, the close stream request will complete the data request and set the status of the IRP to STATUS\_CANCELLED.

```
INIT_AVCSTRM_HEADER(pAVCStrmReq, AVCSTRM_CLOSE);
pAVCStrmReq->AVCStreamContext = pStrmExt->AVCStreamContext;  // From cached context saved in OPEN_STREAM request
Status = 
    AVCStrmReqSubmitIrpSynch( 
        pDevExt->pBusDeviceObject,
        pStrmExt->pIrpReq,
        pAVCStrmReq
        );
```
